        "Google Colab gives us the ability to run Python code on their servers in a familiar Jupyter Notebook environment. streamlit is a Python library where we can quickly develop interactive web-based applications, ideal for building data products and serving machine learning models. When we run streamlit on Google Colab we need a way to connect our local browser to the application which is running on the Google Colab server. ngrok helps establish a tunnel between our local browser and the application.\r\n",

When we try this, we get a defunct process, which requires us to issue a ```kill -9 ppid``` command, where ```ppid``` is the process id of the parent. In the case of this setup, the ```ppid``` of the streamlit process is ```pid=1```, which is the ```node``` process. The current workaround is to Factory Reset the runtime (essentially rebooting the server), perhaps there is a better way to handle \r\n",
